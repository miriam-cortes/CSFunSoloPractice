practice for problems in CS Fundamentals

1. (done!) Implement a function to add a Node to the beginning of a doubly linked list.
2. (done!) Implement a function to remove a Node from the beginning of a doubly linked list.
3. (done!) Implement a function to add a Node at the second position in a doubly linked list.
4. (isn't this the same as #2??) Implement a function to remove the second Node from a doubly linked list.
5. (done!) Empty a singly linked list
6. (done!) Empty an array of size 20. Empty = uninitialize all cells to -1
7. (done!) Insert a node into a sorted singly linked list with value 999.
8. () Add an element with value 999 to a sorted array. The array is of size 20. All unassigned entries have value INT_MAX, which is specially reserved for this purpose. All unassigned entries are at (or shifted to be at) the end of the array.
9. (done!) Delete nodes in a singly linked list with specified data value e.g. int value of 5
10. () Remove entries from an array with specified data value e.g. int value of 5 The array is of size 20 and all unassigned entries have value INT_MAX, which is specially reserved for this purpose. All unassigned entries are at (or shifted to be at) the end of the array.
11. (done!) Print the largest integer data value in a singly linked list
12. () Print the largest integer data value in a native int array
13. (done!) Print all integer data values in a singly linked list
14. (done!) Print all integer data values in a native int array
15. Explain: what is a memory leak?
16. Explain: what is an access violation?
17.
